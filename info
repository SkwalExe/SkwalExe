I am trying to test something. I was looking through different repositories and I noticed something extremely weird. There was always the same user under the "Used By" section of the repo. I think this "Used By" feature can be abused, I will try to display my profile under two famous repos (vim and bash). If it works then I will try to open a ticket to github if no one already did it, this seems to have went unnoticed for a long time.

It worked, look at the README.
